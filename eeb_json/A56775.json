This pamphlet is not included among the works of Pechey listed in DNB. It is attributed by Halkett and Laing, 1926, to \"John Peachie or Pechey, M.D.\" (presumably the extra-licentiate). This attribution is probably wrong, since John Peachie was not admitted an extra-licentiate of the College of Physicians until 1683.","Reproduction of original in Huntington Library."],"editionDate":"1682","language":"eng","keywords":["Scurvy."]}
