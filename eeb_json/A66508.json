The two parts are, however, bound together by the general title-page and the signatures of the indexes. The precise meaning of 'Editio tertia' on the general title is dubious, unless foreign issues are counted, of the English translation, and even so it is not an accurate statement.\" -- Madan 3239.","Reproduction of the original in the British Library."]}
