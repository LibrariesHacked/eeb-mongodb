Thomas Pride at his late purge thought convenient to leave sitting at Westminster ... who ... pretendedly stile themselves ... the Parliament of England, intrusted and authorised by the consent of all the people thereof, whose representatives by election ... they are; although they are never able to produce one bit of a law, or any piece of a commission to prove, that all the people of England, ... authorised Thomas Pride, ... to chuse them a Parliament, as indeed he hath de facto done by this pretended mock-Parliament: and therefore it cannot properly be called the nations or peoples Parliament, but Col. Pride's and his associates, whose really it is; who, although they have beheaded the King for a tyrant, yet walk in his oppressingest steps, if not worse and higher.","author":"Lilburne, John, 1614?-1657.","publicationStmtPlace":"London :","publicationStmtDate":"Printed in the grand yeer of hypocriticall and abominable dissimulation. 1649.","publicationStmtPublisher":"[s.n.],","editionDate":"1649"}
